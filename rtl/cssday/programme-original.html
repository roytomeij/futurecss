            <h2>Flexbox, by Zoe Mickley Gillenwater</h2>
            <p>Flexbox and responsive web design go great together, like peanut butter and jelly. Flexbox gives you more control over the things you care about in a responsive layout—like order, alignment, and proportional sizes of your boxes—and lets the browser figure out the rest—the math-y stuff that computers are good at, like the exact dimensions that are needed on the boxes to perfectly fill the available space. You can create much more complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS.</p>
            <p>In this talk, you’ll learn which features of flexbox are particularly suited to responsive layouts and how you can harness them today by applying flexbox as progressive enhancement. We’ll look at examples of responsive page components and patterns that you can enhance further by layering flexbox on top of other layout methods, ensuring all users get a good experience.</p>

            <h2>Grid Layout, by Rachel Andrew</h2>
            <p>Since the early days of the web, designers have been trying to lay out web pages using grid systems. Likewise, almost every CSS framework attempts to implement some kind of grid system, using floats and often leaning on preprocessors. The CSS Grid Layout module brings us a native CSS Grid system for the first time—a grid system that does not rely on document source order, and can create complex layouts which are easily redefined with media queries. Following along with practical examples, you’ll learn how Grid works, and how it can be used to implement modern layouts and responsive designs.</p>

            <h2>Defining “auto”, by fantasai</h2>
            <p>fantasai will explain how a layout engine works, what are the various primitives that go into “automatic” sizing, and how the CSS Working Group incorporates these into the design of new layout systems. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of what “auto” means, and how to incorporate the right automatic sizing rules into your adaptive layouts.</p>

            <h2>Typography on the Web, by John Daggett</h2>
            <p>Typography on the web has improved dramatically in the past few years with the wide availability of web fonts and browser support for basic typographic features. As browsers slowly implement support for font features, color font formats and better control over font display during loading, authors will be better able to customize more precisely how type appears in the browser. At the same time, type designers are coming up with clever solutions to problems associated with fonts for the web. This session will cover the current state of type in the browser and improvements on the horizon.</p>

            <h2>Responsive Color, by Clarissa Peterson</h2>
            <p>Color is one of the first things we learn how to do in CSS — and yet many of us don’t ever go further than typing hex numbers handed to us by a designer. But getting colors to appear on a screen is just the beginning. Discover the secrets behind hex color values, and how to use simple math to adjust color attributes like saturation and brightness. Find out why colors look different on different devices, and what you can do about it. Learn how to adjust colors with media queries to make sure your colors look their best on any screen size. Find out how user context may affect the appropriate colors for a website. And finally, learn how you can make this whole color thing a lot less complicated by using a CSS preprocessor like Sass to manage your color choices and create color variations automatically.</p>

            <h2>Responsive Principles, by Paul Robert Lloyd</h2>
            <p>Five years since its introduction, responsive web design has become an accepted best practice for developing websites. Furthermore, it has engendered a wider conversation about building products that can accommodate an increasing range of connected devices. This talk will aim to provide a framework within which we can model this discussion, and outline the principles needed for our work to better adapt to a rapidly changing world.</p>

            <h2>The future of CSS isn’t CSS, by Roy Tomeij</h2>
            <p>The future of CSS, at least for the foreseeable future, will be pre-processors. They allow us to use next generation CSS syntax today, while still supporting older browsers. Let’s explore how we could benefit from a more programmatic approach to writing CSS, and go batshit crazy on Sass.</p>

            <h2>The Back(side) of the Class, by Stephen Hay</h2>
            <p>Have you ever been taught that “modularizing” CSS via an endless number of “reusable” object-like “classes” is the “proper” way to use CSS on “large-scale websites”, or have you taught others that these are “best practices”? Do you think there’s a difference between the term “large-scale websites” and “enterprise websites”? When I say “inheritance” and “specificity”, do you feel dirty?</p>
            <p>If you answered yes to the above questions, then you, my friend, are going to absolutely <em>hate</em> this session.</p>
